Awesome. Based on your answers:

* ✅ Project name: `stack-crawler`
* ✅ Scraping platforms: Let’s go with **Wellfound**, **Cutshort**, and **Remotive** (good mix, public listings, manageable HTML)
* ✅ Storage: **Neon Postgres** (solid choice, scalable, cloud-friendly)
* ✅ Frontend: Minimal or none (maybe API testing via Swagger UI for now)
* ✅ Hosting: **Render**

Here’s your complete, polished `README.md` for **`stack-crawler`** 👇

# 🕷️ Stack Crawler – Job Stack Insights from Real Listings

`stack-crawler` is a backend-focused project that scrapes real job listings from platforms like Wellfound, Cutshort, and Remotive, storing and analyzing the required tech stacks used across companies.

It helps identify what technologies are trending and in demand, especially useful for devs exploring the job market or aligning their skillset with real industry needs.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Scrapes job data from multiple job platforms
- 🧠 Extracts and analyzes required technologies (stacks)
- 💾 Stores data in Neon Postgres (or local JSON for testing)
- ⚡ Exposes clean REST API via FastAPI
- 🧪 Swagger UI auto-generated for testing endpoints
- 📊 (Optional) Future dashboard to visualize trends

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer     | Tech |
|-----------|------|
| Scraper   | Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup |
| Backend   | FastAPI, Uvicorn |
| Storage   | Neon Postgres (via SQLAlchemy) |
| Hosting   | Render |
| Frontend  | Minimal (Swagger UI or basic HTML) |

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ctrly4sh/stack-crawler.git
cd stack-crawler
````

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Neon Postgres Connection

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://<username>:<password>@<host>/<db_name>
```

(Replace with actual Neon DB or any supported SQL db credentials)

---

## 🔌 Running the API Locally

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Once running, go to:

* `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` → Swagger UI (test endpoints)
* `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping` → Health check

## 🧪 Sample Endpoints

| Method | Route     | Description                         |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/ping`   | Health check                        |
| GET    | `/jobs`   | Get latest scraped jobs             |
| GET    | `/stats`  | (Planned) Tech stack frequency      |
| POST   | `/scrape` | Trigger a scrape from all platforms |


## 📌 Notes

* You can test scrapers and API routes independently using Swagger UI or Postman.
* Project follows modular structure to allow easy scaling (e.g., adding more platforms).
* JSON fallback for data storage available if DB isn't configured.
